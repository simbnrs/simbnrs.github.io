abstract = {Road transportation accounts for up to 35% of carbon dioxide and 49% of nitrogen oxides emissions in the Paris region. However, estimates of city traffic patterns are often incomplete and of coarse spatio-temporal resolution, even where extensive networks of sensors exist. This study uses a machine learning approach to analyze data from 2086 magnetic road sensors across Paris, generating a detailed dataset of hourly traffic flow and road occupancy covering 6846 road segments from 2018 to 2022. Our model captures flow and occupancy with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 37% and 54% respectively, providing high-resolution insights into traffic patterns. These insights allow for the creation of a comprehensive map of hourly transportation patterns in Paris, offering a robust framework for assessing traffic variables for each significant road link in the city. The modelâ€™s ability to incorporate an emission factor based on the mean speed of the vehicle fleet, derived from flow and occupancy data, holds promise for developing a detailed CO2 and pollutant inventory. This methodology is not limited to Paris; it can be applied to other urban centers with similar data availability, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for sustainable urban monitoring.}
